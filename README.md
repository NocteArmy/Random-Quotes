# Random Quote App
This is a simple random quote app created as per the instructions on freeCodeCamp for the legacy Front End Developer Certificate. The app has a list of favourite quotes and also calls an API to a random quote generator. The user has the option to tweet the quote.

There is a working version of this repo at the following link: [Random Quote App](https://codepen.io/noctearmy/pen/ZoLObj)
